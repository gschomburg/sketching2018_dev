                    July 27 through July 29
                    <br/> David Whitney Building

                <p>The possibility created by digital technology today to directly alter the physical world is perhaps only equalled by the
                postwar material science explosion. The 1950s and 60s gave us metal replacement hips and Tupperware. Today we have (or will
                soon have) woodworking tools that compensate for their operator’s imprecision, CAD tools that anticipate and correct for
                errors, sensor-enabled logistics chains, and robots that etch musical grooves into frozen lakes (cf Kazuhiro Jo’s Sketching
                presentation last year). The wisdom of lifetimes can be algorithmically distilled, extended, shared and embedded invisibly
                in everyday physical objects. Expertise is now a design material. What are the tools we need to build for and in this world?
                What are the creative and technical possibilities?</p>
                <p>What are the warnings we should be heeding? How should we heed them?</p>
            </div>

                </div>
                <p>TBD**** This charrette focuses on the way that potent tools/technologies have the potential to reorganize human society, in ways
                    that are predicted or desired-and sometimes ways that are not. It's about implements and the institutions that grow to
                    condone, perpetuate, and extend them. Responding to a set of broad human challenges, we will sketch new ideas that could
                    be built in the reality of 2017. Using those ideas as starting points, we will imagine what 2030 might look like if our
                    ideas were to grow to scale.

                        <p>Supplyframe was founded by Steve Flagg in 2003 to help electronics engineers design products in a more labor and cost saving
                    way. The opportunity was to use the then-strange-and-new internet to be embedded in tools that predict part availability
                    and fit. By 2018, Supplyframe has developed a number of powerful tools that are essential to hardware engineers and procurement
                    alike, and are now the most reliable way to find and replace components to design a mass produced product from start to finish.</p></li>
