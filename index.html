                <h2>The New Machine Age</h2>
                <div class="details">

                <p>The possibility created by digital technology today to directly alter the physical world is perhaps only equalled by the
                postwar material science explosion. The 1950s and 60s gave us metal replacement hips and Tupperware. Today we have (or will
                soon have) woodworking tools that compensate for their operator’s imprecision, CAD tools that anticipate and correct for
                errors, sensor-enabled logistics chains, and robots that etch musical grooves into frozen lakes (cf Kazuhiro Jo’s Sketching
                presentation last year). The wisdom of lifetimes can be algorithmically distilled, extended, shared and embedded invisibly
                in everyday physical objects. Expertise is now a design material. What are the tools we need to build for and in this world?
                What are the creative and technical possibilities?</p>
                <p>What are the warnings we should be heeding? How should we heed them?</p>

                <h2>Charrette</h2>
                <h2>Synthetic tools for designing the New Machine Age</h2>
                <div>Monday July 30
                    <br/> The Henry Ford
                    <br/> Dearborn, Michigan
                </div>
                <p>This charrette is intended to let Sketching participants respond to the ideas brought up during the summit through discussion
                and hands-on making. It’s set in the Henry Ford Museum to provide context and let the successes and failures (technological,
                social or both) of past innovation guide the design of future technology design tools. As the boundaries fade between hardware,
                software, robotics and architectural environments, and as artificial intelligence, coupled with models of human behavior,
                erase the boundaries between the capabilities of people and those of their digital tools, I think the design of tools for
                creating new physical and digital products becomes a critical activity when trying to change present conditions in the world
                to more desirable ones. Basically: tools create the envelopes of possible designs created with them, and I think the shape
                of those envelopes should not be left to chance, but consciously designed.

                        <p>Supplyframe was founded by Steve Flagg in 2003 to help electronics engineers design products in a more labor and cost saving
                    way. The opportunity was to use the then-strange-and-new internet to be embedded in tools that predict part availability
                    and fit. By 2018, Supplyframe has developed a number of powerful tools that are essential to hardware engineers and procurement
                    alike, and are now the most reliable way to find and replace components to design a mass produced product from start to finish.</p></li>
